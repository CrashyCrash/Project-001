# Project-001: Enhanced Interpreter Framework

## Overview
This project significantly enhances Open Interpreter by integrating robust features for advanced logging, monitoring, error recovery, and automation. Designed to streamline workflows and ensure high reliability, it serves as a foundation for complex AI-driven task orchestration.

## Features
- **Automated Environment Setup**: Automatically configures and initializes the required environment and dependencies.
- **Advanced Logging**: Implements log rotation, detailed error tracking, and runtime monitoring for better traceability.
- **Error Recovery System**: Intelligent error handling and recovery logic, including dynamic retry mechanisms and fallback strategies.
- **State Management**: Real-time monitoring and persistent state storage ensure system consistency across sessions.
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering error handling, recovery, and system state validation.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy integration with additional tools and workflows.

## Directory Structure
- `logger.py`: Utility for logging with advanced formatting and rotation.
- `state_manager.py`: Manages and tracks persistent and real-time system states.
- `error_manager.py`: Handles error categorization, dynamic recovery, and retry mechanisms.
- `integration_test.py`: Suite for testing logging, state management, and error recovery.
- `env_manager.py`: Automates environment setup and dependency management.
- `logs/`: Directory for storing log files (`activity.log`, `error.log`, etc.).
- `system_state.json`: JSON file storing persistent state information.
- `configs/`: Contains configuration files for customizable project settings.
- `src/`: Source code for additional modules and functionalities.
- `build/`: Build artifacts and temporary files.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
