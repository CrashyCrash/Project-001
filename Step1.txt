PERFECT. Let's get started on implementing this. 


I love your idea to "Refactor into Modules:  Break down the code into modules (logger.py, error_manager.py, env_manager.py, state_manager.py) for easier maintenance."

So with that in mind, let's get started with "Step 1. Environment Initialization"

I've already written your proposed python code into /Users/crashair/AI-Software/_Interpreter/Projects/Project-001/project-001-profile.py for us to use on a new project in the /Users/crashair/AI-Software/_Interpreter/Projects/Project-001 directory. How do you recommend we best proceed to accomplish this?

1. Environment Initialization:
	•	Tasks:
	•	Create a setup_environment() function to:
	•	Check for and set up a virtual environment (e.g., venv) if needed.
	•	Install necessary dependencies (e.g., npm install) from a package.json template.
	•	Create a consistent folder structure:
	•	logs/ for error/activity logs.
	•	src/ for source code.
	•	build/ for build outputs.
	•	configs/ for configuration files.
	•	Validate Node.js, npm, and Python versions, logging warnings if versions are outdated.
	•	Verification: Run the setup on a fresh machine to ensure all directories and dependencies are correctly installed and logged.
