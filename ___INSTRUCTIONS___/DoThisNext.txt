“Please ensure the following tasks are completed across the provided files (logger.py, state_manager.py, test_env_manager.py) to resolve all logger-related issues and ensure the test scripts function properly:
	1.	Logger Integration:
	•	Ensure the logger is correctly initialized and accessible in all files.
	•	Verify that logger.py contains properly defined methods for logging (log_info, log_error, etc.).
	•	Update any imports to reference logger correctly.
	2.	State Manager Compatibility:
	•	Verify compatibility of state_manager.py with the logger setup.
	•	Ensure state_manager logs actions correctly using the logger.
	3.	Test Adjustments:
	•	Adjust test_env_manager.py (and similar test files) to use the updated logger methods (log_info, log_error).
	•	Fix the error related to Logger object lacking attributes (e.g., log_info, log_error).
	4.	Testing Workflow:
	•	Update the pytest test scripts to correctly call and verify logger actions.
	•	Ensure there are no hard-coded paths or invalid references across the test files.
	5.	Debugging Steps:
	•	If any logger functionality fails, generate detailed error messages for debugging.
	•	Save logs in a centralized folder and ensure the path is dynamically generated.

Make only the necessary changes and ensure the updates work seamlessly with the current project structure. After completing the fixes, re-run all tests to confirm the functionality. Output the updated code for each file and any changes you make for review.”
