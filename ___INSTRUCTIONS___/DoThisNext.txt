# Perform the final cleanup, verification, and preparation for Git:

1. **Clean Up Logs**:
   - Delete all log files in the `logs/` folder:
     ```bash
     rm -f logs/*.log
     ```
   - Add a `.gitkeep` file to preserve the folder structure:
     ```bash
     touch logs/.gitkeep
     ```

2. **Remove Redundant Files**:
   - Delete `.DS_Store` files:
     ```bash
     find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
     ```
   - Move unnecessary files to the `misc/` folder:
     - `temp_runtime_exception.txt`
     - `test_env_manager.py.save`

3. **Update `.gitignore`**:
   - Ensure the following entries are included:
     ```
     misc/
     *.log
     logs/
     !logs/.gitkeep
     .DS_Store
     ```

4. **Run Integration Tests**:
   - Execute the tests again to confirm everything is functioning:
     ```bash
     python -m unittest integration_test.py -v
     ```

5. **Verify Program Execution**:
   - Run the main script to ensure the project works as intended:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

# Stop after completing these steps and confirm readiness for Git initialization and commit.
