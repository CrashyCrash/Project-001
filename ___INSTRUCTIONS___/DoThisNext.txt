1. Add all current project files to Git:

git add .
git commit -m “Save current project state with verified tests and Loguru setup”
git push origin main

2. Create a local backup of the `Project-001` directory and save it as `Project-001-backup.tar.gz` in the same folder:

3. Export the current Python dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file and update the GitHub repository:

pip freeze > /Users/crashair/AI-Software/_Interpreter/Projects/Project-001/requirements.txt
git add /Users/crashair/AI-Software/_Interpreter/Projects/Project-001/requirements.txt
git commit -m “Updated requirements.txt”
