Test concurrency handling for the platform by simulating multiple processes accessing shared resources. Create a Python script that:
		•	Simultaneously updates the system_state.json file from multiple threads or processes.
	•	Simultaneously logs messages to log_output.log from multiple threads or processes.
	•	Ensures no race conditions, overwrites, or data corruption occur during concurrent access.
	•	Implements and tests file locking mechanisms, if necessary, to maintain stability.

	Execute the script, collect results, and provide recommendations for improvements or fixes to avoid concurrency-related issues.
